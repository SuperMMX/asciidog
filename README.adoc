= AsciiDog

AsciiDog is an implementation in http://groovy-lang.org[Groovy] of the
popular lightweight markup language http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc]
(another popular implementation is http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]).

There is no official AsciiDoc grammar yet, but people are
http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Asciidoc-syntax-definition-td1920.html[showing interest]
to create one.

This project is still in very early stage, and not ready for any
kind of usage.
